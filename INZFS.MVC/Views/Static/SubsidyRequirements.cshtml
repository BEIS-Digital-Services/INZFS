        <p class="govuk-body">There are two categories of aid available through EEF.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">These are:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>aid for start-ups</li>
            <li>aid for research and development projects</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The amount and type of funding your project may receive, as well as your minimum contribution, depends on:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>your organisation's size</li>
            <li>your project's research category</li>
            <li>whether you're applying on your own or as part of a consortium</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Answer the following questionnaire to find out which category applies to you.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Make a note of your total eligible aid and minimum contribution, as you'll need it to complete the project cost breakdown template in section 6.2 </p>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-9">You will also need to make a note of your partners' total eligible aid and minimum contribution, if relevant, to fill in tab B (Partner Breakdown) of the Project cost breakdown template in section 6.2.</p>
