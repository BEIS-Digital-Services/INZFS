                <p class="govuk-body">If you're a sole applicant, you can apply under:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>aid for start-ups</li>

                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body">If your business is a start-up, it does not necessarily mean you can apply under the aid for start-ups category.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">Read the following guidance to find out which category applies to you.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Aid for start-ups</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">To be eligible for aid for start-ups you must be:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>a small or micro business</li>
                    <li>less than five years old (this is from the date you registered your business with Companies House, including any inactive periods)</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body">You must not:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>have listed on any stock exchange</li>
                    <li>paid money to shareholders through dividends</li>

                <p class="govuk-body">You must also have spent at least 10% of your operating costs on R&D in at least one of the past three years.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">If you’re a start-up with no financial history, you need to get an external auditor to certify that you’ve spent 10% of your operating costs on R&D in the current financial period.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Aid for research and development (R&D)</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-9">If you're not eligible for aid for start-ups, you should apply under this category.</p>
